# Sample Data

This directory contains sample data (HDF_example.csv) from an ESB smart meter. In addition there is a selection of generated reports for various providers and a script that can generate these reports. 

Each report applies pricing details from a particular provider plan. Note that the rates used may be out of date and should be checked.

You could copy your ESB HDF file over the HDF_example.csv and then run gen_reports.sh to regenerate all reports and obtain a price model for you usage against each plan.
