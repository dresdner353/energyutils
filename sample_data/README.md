# Sample Data

This directory contains sample data (HDF_example.csv) from an ESB smart meter. In addition there is a script that can generate reports based on pricing details from provider plans. Note that the rates used may be out of date and should be checked.

You could copy your ESB HDF file over the HDF_example.csv and then run gen_reports.sh to regenerate all reports and obtain a price model for you usage against each plan.
